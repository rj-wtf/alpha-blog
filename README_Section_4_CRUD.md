# CRUD and scaffold generators - Text directions, references and code
Query language to communicate with database: SQL (Structured Query Language)

CRUD actions:

C - Create

R - Read

U - Update

D - Delete

Scaffold generator command to create an article model (with two attributes), articles controller, views for articles and migration file to create articles table:

rails generate scaffold Article title:string description:text

Command to see routes presented in a viewer-friendly way:

rails routes --expanded

The line resources :articles in the config/routes.rb file provides the following routes:

- index of articles (GET request)

- new article (GET)

- create article (POST)

- edit article (GET)

- update article (PUT and PATCH)

- show article (GET)

- delete article (DELETE)

From UI perspective ->

- index lists all the articles in the articles table in the database of the app

- new article deals with the form to enter in new article details

- create handles the submission of the items in the new article form

- edit article deals with the form to enter edited information for an existing article

- update article deals with the submission of the edit article form

- show article displays an individual article based on selection

- delete article deletes an article from the articles table

# Introduction to Section 4: Tables, migrations and naming conventions
Rails naming conventions - Articles resources
- model
- Table
- controller
- views
## Resource: Articles
The resource will have an articles model, articles table, articles controller, and also views that allow us to perform all the CRUD actions from the front end. Let's start by looking at the Model and Table.
### Rails naming conventions - Articles resource
- Model name: article (Rails will define an article (singular))
- Article model file name: article.rb
- Article model class name: Article
- Table name: articles (Rails will maintain articles (plural))
We will start by building the table.

![articles table](articles_table.png)

1. The id column will be automatically generated by Rails. It will be the primary key of this table.
2. title property will be string (255 character limit)
3. description property will be text (as provides for more text than string)

To generate a table we need a migration file.
